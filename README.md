## How to use responsive grid?
- If you want 4 columns then say that it is a column with a span of depending on the number of columns.
	Let's say we want 4 columns so each column occupies has same span
	```
	<section class="row">
		<div class="col span-1-of-4">Col-1</div>
		<div class="col span-1-of-4">Col-2</div>
		<div class="col span-1-of-4">Col-3</div>
		<div class="col span-1-of-4">Col-4</div>
	</section>
	```
- Similarly if we want 3 columns but 1 column should have 2/3 width then?
	```
	<section>
		<div class="col span-2-of-3">Col-1</div>
		<div class="col span-1-of-3">Col-2</div>
		<div class="col span-1-of-3">Col-3</div>
	</section>
	```
